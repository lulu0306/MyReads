# MyReads Project

**these project is based on React basics , with them i built a Bookshelf app from 
Udacity React Nanodegree these app allows you to select and categorise books you
have read, are reading or want to read**




#App Functionality

 In this app the main main page holds the three shelves to make the selection
of its actual state, that are :

-Currently Reading 
-Want To Read

each book have a button that lets you select the state of each book , when the state
changes the book also , the main page contains a button that leads you to the 
search page which lets  you add more books to read , the books that are on the search 
page have a value of none which changes when the selector changes , and with it the state 
changes in the search page and boths states of the books change in the search and in the 
shelves too, when a book in the shelves page is set to none the book automatically
return to the BookAPI where is store again there
